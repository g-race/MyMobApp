            <p>If you're planning for an adventurous getaway, you cannot exclude Olongapo City in your must see list to visit. Located along the western shores of Central Luzon, Olongapo City is a two hour drive northwest of Manila and can be reached by plane via the Subic Bay International Airport. </p>

<p>The place itself has a lot of interesting stories and an inspiring history to tell. Prior to 1980, Olongapo went by the nickname, “Sin City of the Philippines". With the election of Dick Gordon as Mayor, he quickly instituted numerous reforms that garnered both local and international awards in public administration and soon, that nickname became a thing of the past. Olongapo City has risen from the ashes and emerged as the premier economic showcase of the Philippines and one of Asia's great tourist destinations. </p>
